Consider adding the following plugins:
- [docsify-dark-mode](https://github.com/anikethsaha/docsify-plugin/tree/master/packages/docsify-dark-mode)
  - Self-explanatory
- [docsify-example-panels](https://vagnerdomingues.github.io/docsify-example-panels/#/)
  - Would allows to to place visual right alongside code block examples
- [docsify-plugin-flexible-alerts](https://github.com/zanfab/docsify-plugin-flexible-alerts)
  - Could prove useful
