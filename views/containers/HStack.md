### Overview
An `HStack` is one of the most basic building blocks of your UI. It is perhaps one of the most used and  useful views in SwiftUI's arsenal. An `HStack` arranges its child views in a horizontal line, with configurable options for how items are aligned along that horizontal line as well as what the spacing between items should be. An `HStack` is still a view, so most view modifiers should still work on it, just as they would on any other views.
