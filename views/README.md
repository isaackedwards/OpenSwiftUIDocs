# Views

This section contains documentation for SwiftUI's various views.

### Overview
> // Could talk about what `View` means, in SwiftUI and the priciples that are used when building layouts in SwiftUI. Things like composability, reusability and somesuch. 
> 
> // Could also include some tips on how to keep your view code clean. This could include things like, referencing functions that perform buisness logic, instead of putting them into the `body`, or for example moving subviews either into separate files or into computed properties. Possibly other tips.
