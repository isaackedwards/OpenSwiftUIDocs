# Welcome to the Open SwiftUI Documentation

> An awesome project.

This is a place where SwiftUI developers can view existing documentation for Apple's SwiftUI framework or add documentation that they feel is missing.

To get started, pick a section from either the sidebar on the left or the navigation bar at the top right. Alternatively, if you are looking for something specific, feel free to use the searchbar in the top left corner.
